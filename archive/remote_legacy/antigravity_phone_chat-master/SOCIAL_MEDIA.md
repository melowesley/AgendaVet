Your remote AI coding cockpit just got a massive aesthetic upgrade! 💎🚀

I've just released v0.2.28 of Antigravity Phone Connect, and it’s our most beautiful update yet. We’ve moved beyond a simple mirror to a "UI/UX Pro Max" experience.

What's New:
✨ The Obsidian Overhaul: A deep, "Space Black" palette paired with gorgeous violet-to-indigo gradients. It feels incredibly premium in the hand. 🍷
✨ Glassmorphism & Micro-animations: Quick-action prompt pills now "float" and glow when you interact with them. 🐚
✨ One-Tap "Explain": Added a new prompt pill to instantly get detailed, elaborate walk-throughs of any code your AI generates. 🧠
✨ Security Purity: Completed a full OWASP-scope security audit and published our first formal SECURITY.md audit log. 🛡️
✨ Flawless Sync: Mobile and Desktop are now perfectly in sync, right down to the history panel dismissals. 🤝

Antigravity Phone Connect remains the ultimate way to stay productive away from your desk.

**Title:** [Showcase] Antigravity Phone Connect v0.2.28: A "UI/UX Pro Max" Overhaul with Obsidian Themes and Security Audits!

Hey everyone! 👋 

I'm back with v0.2.28 of **Antigravity Phone Connect**, and this one is all about **Aesthetics and Pro Features**. 📱💎

If you haven't seen it, this is an open-source tool that mirrors your desktop AI coding assistant (like Antigravity) to your phone so you can monitor those long "thinking" sessions while grabbing a coffee.

**The "UI/UX Pro Max" Highlights:**

🍷 **Obsidian & Violet**: We shifted to a high-contrast "Obsidian" theme with gorgeous violet accent gradients. It looks and feels like a professional mobile companion app.
    
🐚 **Glassmorphism**: The prompt controls (Continue, Explain, Fix Bugs) now use beautiful glassmorphism effects with blurred backdrops and interactive glows. The buttons actually "float" on your screen.

🧠 **New "Explain" Action**: I added a one-tap action for the "Bathroom Use Case"—when you just want the AI to walk you through its logic without typing a single word on your phone.

🤝 **Perfect Sync**: Closing the history view on mobile now instantly closes the desktop popup via a remote CDP "Escape" relay. No leftover UI clutter!

🛡️ **Security Audit**: We performed a formal security sweep and added a persistent `SECURITY.md` report.

Antigravity Phone Connect is built with Node.js, Python, and Chrome DevTools Protocol. Check out the new look on GitHub!

Remote control just became 100% deterministic! 🎯🚀

I've just released v0.2.24 of Antigravity Phone Connect, and it’s our most precise update yet. If you've ever struggled with misclicks or "sync-fighting" between your phone and desktop IDE, this is for you.

What’s under the hood:
✅ **Deterministic Targeting Engine** — We’ve completely solved the "Duplicate Element" problem. Whether you have 1 or 10 "Run" buttons in your history, your tap now hits the exact one you intended. 🎯
✅ **Leaf-Most filtering** — Our new "Zero-Proxy Filter" identifies the precise inner node of any button, ending the "Nested DOM Trap" forever. 🖱️
✅ **Security Purity** — Hardcoded secrets are gone! All sensitive tokens (Session Secret, Auth Salt) are now fully externalized for better audit scores. 🛡️
✅ **Paranoid Mode Audit** — Conducted a full OWASP-scope security sweep and logged the results in our new `SECURITY.md`. 🟢

Antigravity Phone Connect remains open-source and dedicated to keeping you productive away from your desk.

**Title:** [Showcase] Antigravity Phone Connect v0.2.24 — Deterministic Remote Clicks and Security Hardening!

Hey everyone! 👋 

I'm back with v0.2.24 of **Antigravity Phone Connect**, my open-source tool that lets you monitor and control your desktop AI sessions from your phone. 📱🚀

This update focuses on **Interaction Integrity** and **Security**:

🎯 **Zero-Miss Clicks**: One of the biggest pain points was clicking identical buttons in long chat histories. We now use **Occurrence Index Tracking** to uniquely identify every single button, so your tap on the 5th "Run" button in the history actually triggers the 5th command on your PC.

🖱️ **Leaf-Most Filtering**: DOM trees can be messy. We implemented a "Zero-Proxy Filter" that automatically pierces through nested containers to target the inner-most interactive node, ensuring clicks are 100% reliable.

🛡️ **Security Hardening**: Fixed the "Security Purist" complaints by externalizing all hardcoded session secrets and auth salts. We also conducted a formal security sweep and added a formal `SECURITY.md` audit log.

📜 **Better Thought Matching**: Expanding/collapsing AI reasoning blocks is now more robust with strict first-line text matching.

If you enjoy keeping an eye on your AI's multi-minute thought processes while grabbing a coffee, check it out!

Remote AI coding just got a massive brain transplant! 🧠🚀

I’m thrilled to release v0.2.21 of Antigravity Phone Connect.

This update is all about deep integration and visual fidelity—making sure your mobile experience is as powerful as your desktop IDE.

What’s new:
✅ Remote Command Actions — "Run" and "Reject" code blocks directly from your phone. Total control, even when you're away from your desk. 🎮
✅ Occurrence Index Tracking — We solved the "multi-button" click problem. Zero misclicks in complex UI trees. 🎯
✅ Base64 Image Fidelity — No more broken images on remote devices! Local assets now render flawlessly via auto-Base64 conversion. 🖼️
✅ Full History Integration — Seamlessly browse and switch between past AI conversations on mobile. 📜

**Title:** [Showcase] Antigravity Phone Connect v0.2.21 — Now with Remote Code Execution control and Flawless Image Fidelity!

Hey everyone! 👋

I've been building an open-source tool that mirrors your desktop AI coding assistant (Antigravity/VS Code) to your phone. It uses a Node/Python bridge with Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) to keep you in the loop even when you step away from your desk.

We just hit v0.2.21, and it's a big one for remote control:

🎮 **Remote Command Actions:** You can now trigger "Run" and "Reject" actions on AI-generated code blocks directly from your phone.
🎯 **Indestructible Clicks:** We implemented "Occurrence Index Tracking" to handle identical buttons in deep UI trees. If it’s on your screen, you can click it with 100% accuracy.
🖼️ **Base64 Rendering:** Fixed the "broken image" issue for remote devices by automatically converting all local SVGs and images to Base64 before streaming.
📜 **Mobile History:** Full integration for browsing and switching between past chat sessions.

**The Tech Stack:**
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express/WS) + Python (Launcher Logic)
- **Protocol:** Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) for DOM scraping and remote interaction.
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JS with aggressive CSS inheritance and glassmorphism styling.

I’d love to hear your thoughts!

**Title:** I built an app to remotely monitor and control Antigravity AI from your phone - Just released v0.2.17 with a new Glassmorphism UI!

Hey everyone!

I've been working on **Antigravity Phone Connect**, a tool that lets you step away from your desk while keeping full sight and control over your Antigravity AI coding sessions. If you've ever felt "tethered" to your computer waiting for a large generation or long thought process to finish, this is for you.

We just pushed v0.2.17, which really hones in on visual polish and compatibility:

✨ **Glassmorphism UI:** We overhauled the mobile quick-action and settings headers using a clean glassmorphism styling. It just feels so much more premium in the hand.
🌙 **Better Dark Mode & Model Tracking:** Since Antigravity relies heavily on themes (with thousands of CSS variables), we refined our "Aggressive CSS Inheritance" to perfectly mask out desktop scrollbars and correctly map dark mode state. Your AI models (like the newest Claude and Gemini drops) are also tracked flawlessly.
🧠 **Always Up To Date:** Confirmed support for the latest AI models.

**How it works under the hood (for the curious):**
Instead of brittle element selection, the Node server establishes a CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) bridge to the desktop IDE. It polls the UI, does delta-detection on the HTML hash, dynamically strips out desktop context bars in real-time, and beams it to your phone over WebSocket.

I'd love for you to check out the repo and let me know what you think!
